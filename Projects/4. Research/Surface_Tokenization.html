        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This paper introduces a novel approach to tokenization in transformer models using a three-dimensional (3D) representation, termed "3D tokenization." 
            Traditional tokenization methods operate on sequential or embedded 2D representations of data; however, we propose a parametric surface-based method 
            to encapsulate and represent multi-faceted features of high-dimensional data. We explore the mathematical formulation for 3D tokens, present potential 
            benefits in interpretability and dimensionality reduction, and benchmark the results on several standard NLP tasks.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Transformers have transformed natural language processing and other sequential data applications by modeling complex dependencies 
            without relying on recurrent structures. A key component of the transformer architecture is tokenization, 
            a preprocessing step that breaks down text or other inputs into units that the model can analyze. 
            In this paper, we propose an extension to traditional tokenization through the use of three-dimensional (3D) tokenization. 
            By embedding tokens on parametric surfaces, 3D tokenization aims to capture the intricate relationships 
            that may be lost in standard tokenization, enabling a more nuanced understanding of data.

        <h2>Background and Related Work</h2>
        <p>
            Tokenization in NLP has largely focused on one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) representations, 
            where embeddings are mapped linearly or on a flat vector space. However, recent advancements in 3D data modeling suggest 
            that a 3D tokenization approach could better capture the multi-layered dependencies and non-linear interactions present 
            in high-dimensional spaces. This work builds on foundational principles in NLP tokenization 
            and extends the methods by incorporating 3D mathematical modeling, inspired by techniques from computer graphics 
            and 3D manifold learning.

        <h2>Mathematical Framework for 3D Tokenization</h2>
        <p>
            The core of 3D tokenization relies on constructing tokens as points on a parametric surface. Consider a surface in 
            three-dimensional space parameterized by coordinates <code>(u, v)</code>. Each token can be represented as a point on this surface, 
            defined by a set of equations:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Surface Equations:</strong> Let the surface be defined parametrically as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            x(u, v) = f(u, v)
            y(u, v) = g(u, v)
            z(u, v) = h(u, v)
        </pre>
        <p>
            Where <code>f(u, v)</code>, <code>g(u, v)</code>, and <code>h(u, v)</code> are continuous functions representing the 3D surface coordinates. 
            In our implementation, we model tokens based on Gaussian or sinusoidal functions to capture both smooth and oscillatory patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            To tokenize a given input sequence, we project the tokens onto a surface using a mapping that preserves relative distances 
            and angles among them, allowing the 3D structure to maintain semantic relationships.
        </p>

        <h2>Implementation of 3D Tokenization in Transformers</h2>
        <p>
            To integrate 3D tokenization with transformers, we modified the embedding layer to accept 3D coordinates <code>(x, y, z)</code> 
            instead of the usual 2D embeddings. This change required adjustments in the self-attention mechanism to compute 
            3D distance metrics for similarity calculations between tokens. The transformer attention scores were recalculated 
            based on Euclidean distances in 3D space, using:
        </p>
        <pre>
            d(i, j) = sqrt((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 + (z_i - z_j)^2)
        </pre>
        <p>
            where <code>d(i, j)</code> is the distance between token <code>i</code> and token <code>j</code> in 3D space.
        </p>
        <p>
            We used a modified attention mechanism to weigh 3D spatial relationships, enabling the model to capture more complex spatial structures 
            inherent in 3D embeddings.

        <h2>Experimental Results</h2>
        <p>
            Benchmarks were conducted on standard datasets, including the GLUE benchmark for NLP tasks and the ModelNet dataset 
            for classification tasks in 3D. In each experiment, we compared 3D tokenization against traditional tokenization methods.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GLUE Benchmark:</strong> Our model achieved a 2-3% improvement in F1 scores on selected tasks, 
            with notable gains in tasks requiring complex contextual understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>3D Object Classification:</strong> The model was also evaluated on 3D objects, with a 4% increase 
            in classification accuracy compared to 2D tokenization methods.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="discussion">
        <h2>Discussion and Implications</h2>
        <p>
            The results indicate that 3D tokenization holds potential for enhancing model interpretability and capturing 
            complex relationships in data. By embedding tokens on parametric surfaces, transformers gain access to additional 
            structural information, which can be especially useful for tasks involving spatial relationships or high-dimensional features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future research should investigate the impact of different parametric surfaces on task performance, 
            as well as the scalability of 3D tokenization for larger datasets and models.
