âš¡ Miniature Pulse Generator â€“ DCX Chol Prototype

Designed for low-latency pulse generation and logic inversion using discrete analog components

â¸»

ðŸ”§ Project Overview

While working at DCX Chol, I developed a compact pulse generator for internal testing of electromechanical harness assemblies. The device was built using a 555 timer IC in monostable (one-shot) mode to emit sharply timed pulses, paired with a discrete dual-MOSFET inverter circuit to control signal polarity for load-agnostic testing scenarios.

ðŸ§© Core Circuitry

Pulse Generation:

555 timer configured in one-shot mode

djustable resistor-capacitor timing network

Single pulse triggered on rising-edge input

Output duration: tunable from 10 Âµs to 1 second

Logic Inversion Stage:

Two MOSFETs wired in series â€” one N-channel, one P-channel

Acts as a non-buffered logic inverter

Ensures clean signal flip with high switching speed and low propagation delay

Used to test the response of reverse-polarity tolerant inputs

ðŸ”Œ Output Stage
	â€¢	TTL-level pulse (5V nominal)
	â€¢	Clean, fast rise/fall edges suitable for triggering logic circuits
	â€¢	Output drive current: up to 100 mA (suitable for small load tests)
	â€¢	Signal available via screw terminals or test pins

ðŸ§ª Use Case at DCX Chol

This prototype was deployed to:
	â€¢	Test digital line filtering, debounce, and EMI rejection in cable harnesses
	â€¢	Validate microcontroller interrupt inputs and external clock capture lines
	â€¢	Simulate power-on glitches and transient control signals during QA

ðŸ§  Significance

Despite its simplicity, the project emphasized fast prototyping, clean analog design, and logical signal flow control using no microcontrollers â€” a practical, field-ready tool in an analog-dominated QA workflow.

Would you like me to export this into a clean PDF (with optional title styling), or embed it in a styled <div> on your electrical portfolio page?

I can also generate a small circuit diagram to accompany it visually.
